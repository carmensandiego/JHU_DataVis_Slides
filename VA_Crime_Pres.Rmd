## Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
This app is a demonstration of the analysis that can be done with a sample of the data available through the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting database (https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/). 


## UCR Statistics Available
There are many statistics available in the UCR database that can be correlated to perform a comprehensive analysis grouped by states. Definitions for each of the fields can be found here: https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/offenses.cfm

- Fields used in this app:
```{r, comment=""}
VA_Murder <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carmensandiego/JHU_DataVis_Data/master/CrimeStatebyState.csv"), skip=8, header=TRUE, nrows=55)   

colnames(VA_Murder)
```
## Correlation Matrix for VA UCR Stats

- The thinner the ellipse, the more correlated the variables are between each other
```{r}
library(corrplot)
M <- cor(VA_Murder[,3:8])
corrplot(M, method = "ellipse", type = "upper")
```

## Future Development
- Include choropleth maps for all states by year for various correlated statistics
- Develop an approach for evaluating crime rates in addition to estimated values
- Include population and housing statistics by state to gauge crime rate trends
